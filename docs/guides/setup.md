# Getting Started

1. Install Ruby 3.2 or newer.
2. Run `bundle install` inside the repository.
3. Execute `bundle exec ruby exe/static_ruby build` to generate the static site (or `bundle exec static_ruby build` once the gem is installed).

You can now open the files in the `build/` directory or run the server command to preview locally.
